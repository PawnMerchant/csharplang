Make the internal function DateTime.GetDatePart() public, such that users could also implement higher performance logic around DateTime structure. Currently if a user needs to do a complicated manipulation with DateTime, the user has to call all three properties DateTime.Year, DateTime.Month, DateTime.Day. Collectively, these three property calls do 3 times the amount of work of a single call to DateTime.GetDatePart() function.
